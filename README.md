# Student Performance Factors Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of the dataset titled **"Student Performance Factors"**, which is sourced from Kaggle. The objective of this project is to explore and analyze various factors affecting student performance, identifying key patterns and correlations.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is available on Kaggle:

- [Student Performance Factors](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors)

It includes a range of features that may influence academic performance, such as demographic information, personal habits, and study-related factors.

## Objective

The main goals of this analysis are:
1. To identify significant factors influencing student performance.
2. To analyze how various features such as study habits, health, and social factors relate to academic outcomes.
3. To provide insights and recommendations for improving student performance.

## Features in the Dataset

The dataset includes the following key features:

- **Gender**: Male/Female
- **Age**: Age of the student
- **Study Time**: Weekly study time in hours
- **Health Status**: Overall health of the student (1-5)
- **Absences**: Number of absences
- **Failures**: Number of past class failures
- **Family Support**: Yes/No
- **School Support**: Yes/No
- **Grade**: Final grade obtained by the student

## Analysis Process

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing data, outliers, and incorrect data entries.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and explore relationships between various features and student performance.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Apply correlation analysis and hypothesis testing to identify significant factors.
4. **Modeling**: Use regression models to predict student performance based on different features.
5. **Conclusions & Insights**: Summarize key findings and provide actionable recommendations.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Data visualization libraries.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for predictive modeling.

## Results

The key findings of the analysis are presented in the final report. They include:
- The impact of study time on student grades.
- The influence of family and school support on academic outcomes.
- The correlation between health status and student performance.
